# Presentation on Kubernetes 

When any new technology comes, in a few months or years it becomes a buzzword. Everyone talks about it and especially if you donâ€™t know about it we also get scared of it. It looks like something very hard, difficult to learn etc. but once you learn it you will realise that it is not that much hard or difficult as we think. With Kubernetes I had the same experience and I hope everyone had the same experience.

So after reading books, blogs and watching videos I felt like let's summarize all this learning knowledge into one small basic presentation which will increase my self confidence and also helpful for all those new beginners who want to learn Kubernetes. The presentation covers below topics:
