# Presentation on Kubernetes 

When any new technology comes, in a few months or years it becomes a buzzword. Everyone talks about it and especially if you donâ€™t know about it you feel like OMG what it is? It looks like something very hard, difficult to learn etc etc. But once you learn it you will realise that it is not that much hard or difficult which we were thinking. With Kubernetes I had the same experience and I hope everyone had the same experience. 

So after reading books, blogs and watching videos I felt like let's summarize all that learning  knowledge into one small basic presentation which will help for all those new beginners who want to learn Kubernetes. The presentation covers the below topics:
